Pages:
Login Page, Create Accounts Page, Splash Page, Home Page (post tweets, view all tweets, hashtags), 
User Page (view all posts from a user), Hashtag Page (view all posts under a hashtag)

Routes: 
Post Routes: Register, Validate Login, Logout, Tweet, Like, Unlike, Delete Post

Design Considerations:
Used Bootstrap for all styling
Showed warnings if someone posts a blank tweet 
If someone logouts but goes back they cannot view their homepage and need to login again
Invalid username, password checks and errors thrown
Delete button only shows up for user's own post, so impossible to delete another user's post through the UI

Collabs: None
